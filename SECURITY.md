## Security Best Practices for MigrateIQ Users

### Deployment Recommendations

1. **Environment Isolation**: Deploy MigrateIQ in an isolated network environment with appropriate access controls.
2. **Regular Updates**: Always use the latest version of MigrateIQ to benefit from security patches.
3. **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls for the MigrateIQ application and its database.
4. **Encryption**: Ensure all data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
5. **Database Security**: Secure the database with strong authentication and encryption.

### Data Protection

1. **Sensitive Data**: Be cautious when migrating sensitive or regulated data (PII, PHI, financial data).
2. **Data Minimization**: Only migrate the data you need; avoid unnecessary transfers of sensitive information.
3. **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive audit logging for all migration activities.
4. **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies for migration logs and temporary data.

### API Security

1. **API Authentication**: Use strong authentication for all API endpoints.
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
3. **Input Validation**: Ensure all input is validated before processing.
